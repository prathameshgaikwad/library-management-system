4. **Publisher Management:** Manage information related to publishers.
5. **Optimized User Experience:** Utilizes hints and helpers to retrieve data from the database for seamless user interaction.

## Technology Stack
- **Java:** Core language for backend logic and application development.
- **MySQL:** Database management system utilized for data storage.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):** Facilitates communication between Java application and MySQL database.
